Hello,
Welcome to the one of the repositories that participate of Arctic Code Vault. ( ^u^~~)
First of all, this project was made to conclude the course of basics computation at Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil.
We were very excited about it! 

Me, and @tartaponei in that time was Chemical Engineering students, so all we have to do was a program that assimilate with the chemistry area, and then EUREKA!
In this repository you can find a .db document wich is responsable for the informations about periodic table, eletronegativity, atomic radius, and more /all stuff we needed to do all the work
what work?
Calculate the distance between two atoms in a chemical ligation
Please be patience, we're just exploring spyder/Python. ^u^
